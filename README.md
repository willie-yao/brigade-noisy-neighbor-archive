# Brigade Noisy Neighbor: One-Step Monitoring for Brigade 2

The purpose of Brigade Noisy Neighbor is to act as a "Noisy Neighbor" and test
the limits of the Brigade 2 dogfood cluster.

Brigade 2 itself is currently in an _beta_ state and remains under active
development, as such, the same is true for this add-on component.
